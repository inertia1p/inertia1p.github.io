*What is Pegging? This sex act is on the rise among straight men*  
>If we told you that a certain sex act could give you the most intense(强烈的；热情的) orgasm(性高潮) of you life, you'd probably jump at the chance to try it. But for whatever reason（不管怎么说）, guys have historically been resistant to expertimenting with prostate（前列腺） play -even though many sexual health experts say it can be a source of tremendous（巨大的） pleasure. 我：？？？这TM不会是gang 交吧？？

>What is pegging? Put simply, pegging is a practice in which a waman anally(肛门) penetrates（穿透） a man with a strap-on. Yup - it's a thing, and many guys are here fo it.  

>OK， I understand. this new told us a sex act 'pegging', and it says if you like to be pegged, it does not mean that you are becoming a 'gay'. and then the news will teach you how to 'pegging' and show some ads about lubes(润滑油= =).

According to the Bachelor alum（n. 明矾？？？） - and Becca's former fiance（未婚夫） hiself - Arie and Lanuren went to the Maldives at "Becca's request" for a conversation that didn't make it（？？？） air. Arie took to instagram Monday night during the Season 14 closer to explain to followers that he and his current wife-to-be made quite the tropical（热带的） trip for the show.
