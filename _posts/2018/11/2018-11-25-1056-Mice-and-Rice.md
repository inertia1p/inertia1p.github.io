## 题目

1056 Mice and Rice （25 分）
Mice and Rice is the name of a programming contest in which each programmer must write a piece of code to control the movements of a mouse in a given map. The goal of each mouse is to eat as much rice as possible in order to become a FatMouse.

First the playing order is randomly decided for N
​P
​​  programmers. Then every N
​G
​​  programmers are grouped in a match. The fattest mouse in a group wins and enters the next turn. All the losers in this turn are ranked the same. Every N
​G
​​  winners are then grouped in the next match until a final winner is determined.

For the sake of simplicity, assume that the weight of each mouse is fixed once the programmer submits his/her code. Given the weights of all the mice and the initial playing order, you are supposed to output the ranks for the programmers.

Input Specification:
Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains 2 positive integers: N
​P
​​  and N
​G
​​  (≤1000), the number of programmers and the maximum number of mice in a group, respectively. If there are less than N
​G
​​  mice at the end of the player's list, then all the mice left will be put into the last group. The second line contains N
​P
​​  distinct non-negative numbers W
​i
​​  (i=0,⋯,N
​P
​​ −1) where each W
​i
​​  is the weight of the i-th mouse respectively. The third line gives the initial playing order which is a permutation of 0,⋯,N
​P
​​ −1 (assume that the programmers are numbered from 0 to N
​P
​​ −1). All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

Output Specification:
For each test case, print the final ranks in a line. The i-th number is the rank of the i-th programmer, and all the numbers must be separated by a space, with no extra space at the end of the line.

Sample Input:
11 3
25 18 0 46 37 3 19 22 57 56 10
6 0 8 7 10 5 9 1 4 2 3
Sample Output:
5 5 5 2 5 5 5 3 1 3 5
**难点：题意理解**

## 思路

每k个选手比较一次加入下一组，留在本轮的选手排名为下一组的size+1。记得在循环比较完后判断是否有剩余选手比出的winner。

## 解题代码

```C++
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int n, k;
int Rank[1001];
vector<int> weight;
void initRank(vector<int> v) {
  if(v.size()==1){
    Rank[v[0]]=1;
    return;
  }
	int i = 0,win=-1,max=-1;
	vector<int> nextl;
	while (i < v.size()) {
		if (i%k == 0) {
			max = -1;
			if (win != -1) {
				nextl.push_back(win);
			}
			win=-1;
		}
		if (weight[v[i]] > max) {
			max = weight[v[i]];
			win = v[i];
		}
		i++;
	}
	if (win!=-1) {
		nextl.push_back(win);
	}
	for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); i++) {
		if (find(nextl.begin(), nextl.end(), v[i]) == nextl.end()) {
			Rank[v[i]] = nextl.size() + 1;
		}
	}
	if(!nextl.empty())initRank(nextl);
}
int main() {
	cin>>n>>k;
	vector<int> order(n);
	weight.resize(n);
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		scanf("%d", &weight[i]);
	}
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		scanf("%d", &order[i]);
	}
	initRank(order);
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		if (i != 0)printf(" ");
		printf("%d", Rank[i]);
	}
	return 0;
}
```
